## TripletDGC: Assessing critical Cell types of Disease Genes by integrating single-cell genomics and human genetics
## Data Availability
We have publicly released TripleDGC, a triplet dataset comprising (Disease, disease Gene, critical Cell type) associations. The dataset can be accessed through the **Result_TabulaSpiens.csv** file in the repository. We also constructed a parallel triplet guided by CellMarker[1],named as **Result_CellMarker.csv** Additionally, a raw CSV version of the dataset is available at [TripletDGC](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19zT4yZDQMNGHc5cVEcTbC5HniD0OnTzm/view?usp=sharing).
